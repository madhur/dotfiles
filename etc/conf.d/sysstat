# By default sa2 script generates yesterday's summary, since the cron job
# usually runs right after midnight. If you want sa2 to generate the summary
# of the same day (for example when cron job runs at 23:53) set this variable.
#YESTERDAY=no

# By default sa2 script generates reports files (the so called sarDD files).
# Set this variable to false to disable reports generation.
#REPORTS=false

# Tell sa2 to wait for a random delay in the range 0 .. ${DELAY_RANGE} before
# executing. This delay is expressed in seconds, and is aimed at preventing
# a massive I/O burst at the same time on VM sharing the same storage area.
# Set this variable to 0 to make sa2 generate reports files immediately.
DELAY_RANGE=0

# The sa1 and sa2 scripts generate system activity data and report files in
# the /var/log/sa directory. By default the files are created with umask 0022
# and are therefore readable for all users. Change this variable to restrict
# the permissions on the files (e.g. use 0027 to adhere to more strict
# security standards).
UMASK=0022

# The sa2 script uses the value below to set environment variable S_REPEAT_HEADER
# which is used by sar as the maximum number of lines after which a header has to
# be displayed (see sar(1) manual page).
#REPEAT_HEADER=25
