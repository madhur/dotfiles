Besides templates for weekdays you can also have arbitrary named templates.
For example you might want to have a template for "Meeting" or "Journey".
All templates must reside in the directory "/home/madhur/.rednotebook/templates".

The template button gives you the options to create a new template or to visit the templates directory.
