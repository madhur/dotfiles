=== This is an example template for Tuesday ===

It has been created to show you what can be put into a template. You can edit and save it with the buttons above.

Templates can contain any formatting or content that is also allowed in normal entries.

Your text can be:

- **bold**
- //italic//
- __underlined__
- --strikethrough--
- or some **//__combination__//**


You can add images to your template:

**Images:** [""/path/to/your/picture"".jpg]

You can link to almost everything:

- **links to files on your computer:** [filename.txt ""/path/to/filename.txt""]
- **links to directories:** [directory name ""/path/to/directory/""]
- **links to websites:** [RedNotebook Homepage ""https://rednotebook.app""]


As you see, **bullet lists** are also available. As always you have to add two empty lines to end a list.

Additionally you can have **titles** and **horizontal lines**:

= Title level 1 =
(The dates in the export will use this level, so it is recommended to use lower
levels in your entries)
== Title level 2 ==
=== Title level 3 ===
etc.

====================

% Commentary text can be put on lines starting with a percent sign.
% Those lines will not show up in the preview and the export.

**Macros**:

When a template is inserted, every occurrence of $date$ is converted to the current date. You can set the date format in the preferences.

There is even more markup that you can put into your templates. Have a look at
the inline help (Ctrl+H) for information.
